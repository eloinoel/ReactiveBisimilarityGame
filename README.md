# ReactiveBisimilarityGame
This project is part of a bachelor's thesis. The aim is to build a video game that plants the seed of intuition for the rather complex concept of reactive bisimilarity in players. Reactive bisimilarity is a semantic notion of equivalence for labelled transition systems (LTS) with timeouts, which represent how processes interact with each other.
